## Result Generation using our approach presented in "A Dataset and Baseline Approach for Identifying Usage States from Non-Intrusive Power Sensing With MiDAS IoT-based Sensors"

- The plot representing the states identified for each test date for a given location are shown in this folder. 
- In the released dataset of 15 days for a location, we have used the first 7 days of data to train our classification model. Rest of the days in the dataset are tested using the trained model to identify the different state.
- The code notebook with all the functionality described above can be found in the _code_ folder.
