# PowerIoT-State-Identification
Repository for details about the dataset shared in our paper "A Dataset and Baseline Approach for Identifying Usage States from Non-Intrusive Power Sensing With MiDAS IoT-based Sensors"
1. The _code_ folder contains the python notebook with documentation of the different methods used in our approach.
2. The _doc_ folder contains our publication.
3. The _data_ folder contains \
  a. _location_states.json_: file containing the details about the states obtained for each location and the respective centers for each state. \
  b. _Excel-file_: State Validation details 
4. The _metadata_ folder contains the metadata for both power and harmonics datasets
6. The _results_ folder contains the graphs with the identified states using our approach for each location in the release dataset.
